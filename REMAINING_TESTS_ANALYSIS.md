## üü¢ **EASY TO TEST WITH REAL DATA** (We have the data)

### 1. **Performance & Coverage Tests**
- [x] **Strategic Question Coverage**: Query response times
- [x] **All ads get comprehensive strategic labels**: Classification success rate
- [x] **Accurately identifies promotional periods vs. brand messaging**: Pattern matching validation
- [x] **Platform consistency scores align with manual assessment**: Manual spot-checking

**How to test:** Run queries on our existing `ads_with_dates` table and measure performance/accuracy.

### 2. **Pattern Detection Tests**
- [x] **Can identify clear strategy shifts in 3-month historical data**: Look for actual shifts in real brand data
- [x] **Trend detection works across multiple competitor brands**: Multi-brand time-series analysis

**How to test:** Use brands like Nike/Adidas that likely have visible strategy changes in 90-day periods.

---

## üü° **MODERATE - REQUIRES SPECIFIC DATA** (Need to find the right examples)

### 3. **Business Validation Tests**
- [x] **Manual review confirms strategic relevance**: Spot-check classifications
- [x] **CTA scoring correlates with business intuition**: Manual validation of scores
- [x] **Recommendations align with creative best practices**: Expert review

**How to test:** Manual review of 50-100 classified ads by growth marketing expert. Need subject matter expertise.

### 4. **Brand Voice & Positioning Tests**
- [x] **Detects intentional brand voice changes in sample data**: Need brands that actually changed voice
- [x] **Platform consistency scores align with manual assessment**: Manual Instagram vs Facebook comparison

**How to test:** Look for brands with known rebrands or platform strategy changes (e.g., Twitter‚ÜíX, Dunkin Donuts‚ÜíDunkin).

## üî¥ **HARD TO TEST WITH REAL DATA** (Better with mock/simulated data)

### 5. **Competitive Copying Detection**
- ‚ùå **Correctly identifies known copying cases in sample data** 
- ‚ùå **Response system flags <5% false positives**

**Why hard:** We need *known* copying cases, but don't have ground truth of which brands actually copied each other.

**Mock data approach:** 
- Create synthetic ads with deliberate similarity patterns
- Plant known copying scenarios with controlled timing
- Test detection accuracy against this ground truth

### 6. **Forecasting Accuracy Tests**
- ‚ùå **Forecast accuracy >70% for 4-week ahead predictions**
- ‚ùå **Confidence bands capture actual outcomes 80% of the time**

**Why hard:** Need historical data from 4+ weeks ago to compare predictions vs actual outcomes. Our dataset may not have sufficient history.

**Mock data approach:**
- Use first 80% of historical data for training
- Test predictions against remaining 20% (holdout validation)
- Create synthetic time-series with known patterns to test accuracy

### 7. **Creative Fatigue (Performance-Based)**
- ‚ùå **Identifies ads using similar messaging with declining performance** ‚Üí **IMPOSSIBLE**
- ‚ùå **Creative Insights**: Fatigue detection prevents 80% of declining creative performance ‚Üí **IMPOSSIBLE**

**Why impossible:** Meta Ad Library doesn't provide performance metrics (CTR, conversions, spend).

**Alternative approach:** Test angle-based fatigue detection using repetition patterns as proxy.

## üìä **RECOMMENDED TESTING STRATEGY**

### Phase 1: Real Data Tests (Quick Wins) ‚ö°
```sql
-- Test 1: Performance benchmarking
SELECT 'STRATEGIC_QUESTION_COVERAGE_TEST' AS test_name,
  -- Time all 4 core strategic queries
  
-- Test 2: Classification accuracy sampling  
SELECT 'CLASSIFICATION_ACCURACY_TEST' AS test_name,
  COUNT(*) as total_classified,
  COUNTIF(funnel IS NOT NULL) / COUNT(*) * 100 as funnel_success_rate

-- Test 3: Strategy shift detection in Nike/Adidas data
SELECT 'STRATEGY_SHIFT_DETECTION_TEST' AS test_name,
  brand, week_start, integrated_strategy_change_type
  FROM v_integrated_strategy_timeseries 
  WHERE integrated_strategy_change_type != 'STABLE_INTEGRATED_STRATEGY'
```

### Phase 2: Business Validation (Manual Review) üë•
- **Sample size:** 100 ads across 5 brands  
- **Review criteria:** Strategic classification accuracy, CTA scoring reasonableness
- **Time required:** 2-3 hours of expert review

### Phase 3: Mock Data Tests (Complex Scenarios) üé≠
```sql
-- Create synthetic copying scenarios
INSERT INTO mock_copying_test_data VALUES
  ('BrandA', 'Get 50% off now!', '2025-01-01'),
  ('BrandB', 'Save 50% today!', '2025-01-05'),  -- 4 days later, >85% similar
  
-- Test detection accuracy
SELECT similarity_score, copying_likelihood 
FROM v_competitive_responses 
WHERE brand = 'mock_test'
```

## üéØ **SUCCESS METRICS**

### Achievable with Real Data:
- Query performance: <30 seconds ‚úÖ
- Classification success: >85% ‚úÖ  
- Strategy shift detection: Find 3+ clear examples ‚úÖ

### Requires Mock Data:
- Copying detection accuracy: >90% on synthetic cases
- Forecast accuracy: >70% on holdout validation
- False positive rate: <5% on controlled scenarios
