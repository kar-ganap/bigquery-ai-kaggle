Competitive Response System - CRAWL_SUBGOALS.md Requirements Test
Tests the specific checkpoints from Subgoal 6: Competitive Response System

Requirements to test:
- [x] Content similarity spike detection (>0.85 similarity appearing within 2 weeks)
- [x] Cross-brand copying identification with timing analysis
- [x] Strategic response recommendations based on competitor moves
- [x] Test: Correctly identifies known copying cases in sample data
- [x] Test: Response system flags <5% false positives

Uses mock data patterns since we don't have embeddings yet
