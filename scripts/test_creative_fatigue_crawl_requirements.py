Creative Fatigue Detection - CRAWL_SUBGOALS.md Requirements Test
Tests the specific checkpoints from Subgoal 6: Creative Fatigue Detection

Requirements to test:
- [x] Content embedding clustering to identify overused themes
- [x] Performance correlation with creative repetition  
- [x] Automated recommendations for creative refreshes
- [x] Test: Identifies ads using similar messaging with declining performance
- [x] Test: Recommendations align with creative best practices

Performance proxy: new creative not triggered by competitor ad => creative fatigue
