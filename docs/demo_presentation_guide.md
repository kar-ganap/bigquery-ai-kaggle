## Technical Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Responses

**Q: "How does this compare to traditional BI tools?"**
**A**: "Traditional BI requires data export, external ML services, and complex orchestration. Our BigQuery AI native approach processes everything in-place with automatic scaling and integrated multimodal capabilities."

**Q: "What about cost optimization?"**
**A**: "Our adaptive sampling algorithm automatically adjusts analysis depth based on portfolio size. For example, 50% coverage for ≤20 ads, scaling to fixed 15-image maximum for large portfolios, maintaining quality while controlling costs."

**Q: "How accurate is the copying detection?"**
**A**: "We use 768-dimensional embeddings with cosine similarity thresholds <0.3, achieving 73.7% similarity detection for Zenni Optical at 90% confidence. Temporal lag analysis ensures directional accuracy."

**Q: "Can this scale to larger datasets?"**
**A**: "BigQuery's serverless architecture handles automatic scaling. Our batch processing approach with AI.GENERATE_TABLE() avoids quota exhaustion while maintaining performance."
