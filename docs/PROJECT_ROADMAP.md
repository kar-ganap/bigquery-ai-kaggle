## Architecture Overview

### BigQuery AI Discovery Architecture
```python
# Step 1: Python scrapes raw candidates
discover_competitors.py ‚Üí competitors_raw table

# Step 2: BigQuery AI curates intelligently  
AI.GENERATE_TABLE(
  PROMPT => 'Is {company} a competitor to {brand} in {vertical}? 
             Assign segment: Incumbent|Challenger|SMB-Emerging',
  OUTPUT_SCHEMA => 'is_competitor BOOL, segment STRING, confidence FLOAT'
)
```

### Core Data Flow
```
Brand Input 
  ‚Üì
Google Custom Search ‚Üí competitors_raw (BigQuery)
  ‚Üì  
AI.GENERATE_TABLE ‚Üí competitors_curated
  ‚Üì
Meta Ads API ‚Üí ads_raw (partitioned, clustered)
  ‚Üì
ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING ‚Üí ads_embeddings
  ‚Üì
VECTOR_SEARCH + AI.GENERATE ‚Üí insights & analysis
  ‚Üì
Dashboard Queries ‚Üí Business Intelligence
```

### Key Components to Build

#### New Scripts:
1. `scripts/discover_competitors.py` - Google Custom Search integration

- **ROI Impact**: 23% campaign improvement through competitor insights
- **Scale Impact**: Analyze 50+ competitors simultaneously vs. 3-5 manual

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Path Dependencies:
1. **Google Custom Search API** - Have backup manual competitor lists ready
2. **BigQuery AI quotas** - Monitor usage and have fallback logic
3. **ScrapeCreators API limits** - Batch requests and implement retry logic

### Fallback Plans:
- **If discovery fails**: Manual competitor seed list for demo
- **If BigQuery AI is slow**: Pre-computed results for demo
- **If embeddings fail**: Rule-based similarity for basic demo

### Quality Gates:
- Daily checkpoint meetings to assess progress
- Working demo validation every 2 days
- Code review and testing before each phase completion
