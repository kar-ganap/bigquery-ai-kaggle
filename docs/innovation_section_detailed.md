## 1. Sophisticated Copying and Creative Fatigue Detection

### Real-Time Competitive Copying Detection

We developed a novel approach to competitive copying detection using `ML.DISTANCE()` with cosine similarity on 768-dimensional embeddings. Our algorithm cross-joins embeddings with temporal filtering (`DATE(b.start_timestamp) >= DATE(a.start_timestamp)`) to mathematically establish copying direction and timing.

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Similarity Threshold**: < 0.3 cosine distance (70%+ similarity)
- **Temporal Logic**: Directional copying detection with lag analysis
- **Real-time Processing**: Immediate detection as new ads enter the system

**Demonstrated Results (Warby Parker Case Study):**
In our analysis of **582 ads** from Warby Parker and its competitors, we detected **Zenni Optical copying Warby Parker creative content with 73.7% similarity** at **90% confidence** - providing immediate competitive threat alerts that enable rapid strategic response.

### Advanced Creative Fatigue Analysis

Our temporal fatigue engine employs 30-day rolling windows (`DATE_DIFF(..., DAY) <= 30`) to calculate semantic similarity between recent ads, implementing a sophisticated 4-tier classification system:

```sql
CASE
  WHEN AVG(similarity) > 0.8 THEN 1.0  -- HIGH fatigue
  WHEN AVG(similarity) > 0.6 THEN 0.7  -- MEDIUM-HIGH fatigue
  WHEN AVG(similarity) > 0.4 THEN 0.4  -- MEDIUM fatigue
  ELSE 0.2  -- LOW fatigue
END as fatigue_score
```

**Innovation Impact (Warby Parker Case Study):**
Our system detected **MODERATE_FATIGUE status** with **average campaign age of 26.9 days** for Warby Parker's creative portfolio, enabling proactive creative refresh recommendations before market saturation occurs.

## 5. Cost-Efficient Adaptive Sampling

### Dynamic Budget Optimization

Our adaptive sampling algorithm automatically adjusts analysis depth based on portfolio size while maintaining cost efficiency:

```sql
CASE
  WHEN COUNT(*) <= 20 THEN LEAST(COUNT(*) * 0.5, per_brand_budget)     -- 50% coverage
  WHEN COUNT(*) <= 50 THEN LEAST(COUNT(*) * 0.3, per_brand_budget)     -- 30% coverage
  WHEN COUNT(*) <= 100 THEN LEAST(COUNT(*) * 0.2, per_brand_budget)    -- 20% coverage
  ELSE LEAST(per_brand_budget, 15)                                      -- Fixed 15 max
END as target_sample_size
```
