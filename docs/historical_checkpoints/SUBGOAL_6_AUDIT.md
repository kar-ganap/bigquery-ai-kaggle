  - Message angle extraction with confidence scoring
  - Categories: PROMOTIONAL, EMOTIONAL, RATIONAL, URGENCY, TRUST
  - Uses gemini-2.5-flash for consistency
  - Structured JSON output with confidence levels 0.0-1.0

- [x] **Strategic Labels** - `sql/06_enhanced_creative_analysis.sql`
  - Funnel stage classification (Upper/Mid/Lower)
  - Persona targeting (New Customer/Existing/General)
  - Topic extraction and urgency scoring
  - Promotional intensity and brand voice analysis

### Time-Series Strategy Intelligence
- [x] **Real Temporal Data Pipeline** - `scripts/ingest_fb_ads.py` (JUST COMPLETED)
  - Extract start_date_string/end_date_string from ScrapeCreators API
  - Duration calculation with active_days
  - Duration quality weighting using tanh function

- [x] **Time-Series Construction** - `sql/create_ads_with_dates.sql` (JUST COMPLETED)
  - Parse ISO timestamps to proper TIMESTAMP fields
  - 2+ day minimum business rule implementation
  - Duration quality weighting: GREATEST(0.2, TANH(active_days / 7.0))
  - Influence tiers: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/MINIMAL based on duration

- [x] **Weekly Aggregation Framework** - `sql/time_series_weekly_aggregation_v2.sql` (JUST COMPLETED)
  - Weekly strategy metrics with real temporal data
  - Recency weighting: EXP(-0.693 * lag_days / 7.0)
  - Media type and influence tier distribution tracking
  - Week-over-week change detection
  - Competitive positioning and market share approximation

### Competitive Response System
- [x] **Competitive Influence Scoring** - `sql/competitive_influence_scoring_v2.sql`
  - Bidirectional influence analysis between brands
  - Duration-weighted influence (2-day ads vs 30-day campaigns)
  - Temporal overlap factor for realistic influence assessment
  - Confidence levels based on source ad quality

### Creative Fatigue Detection
- [x] **Competitor-Based Fatigue Detection** - `sql/creative_fatigue_competitor_based.sql`
  - Uses competitor influence as performance proxy
  - Logic: high originality in new ads = fatigue in previous ones
  - Originality score = 1 - AVG(competitor_influence_score)
